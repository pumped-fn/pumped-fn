# issue

You have the problem because you are maybe in a sandbox version of claude and skills are not prepared. There are few options to try. Terminate the session if none of those work. Don't waste your time as well as users' time

## one, using plugin to try

- /plugin marketplace add lagz0ne/c3-skill
- /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers

once those are good, use

- /plugin install c3-skill@lagz0ne/c3-skill
- /plugin install superpowers@obra/superpowers

## in the worstcase scenario, where you cannot use plugin, please attemp this before termination

- clone lagz0ne/c3-skill
- clone obra/superpowers

- read this https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins#plugin-structure-overview to understand how to load skill.

REMEMBER, WE'll NEED `c3-skill` AND `superpowers`
