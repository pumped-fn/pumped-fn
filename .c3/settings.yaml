  once the ADR is created, we'll do
  - use /superpowers:write-plan to create a plan
  - review the plan and refine with removing all of superficial details, focusing on making plan happen in parallel
  - up quality level by defining a very high standard of review for each task
  - the plan should also include running, cleaning up  /c3-skill:c3-audit, marking ADR completed
