# pumped-fn

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pumped-fn/lite)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pumped-fn/lite)

`pumped-fn` is a TypeScript package family for building application systems around explicit boundaries.
It gives you a small core runtime for dependency graphs, execution-scoped work, lifecycle cleanup,
reactive state, and test seams, plus React bindings and structural guardrails for larger codebases.

The main idea is simple: put the system behind a scope. Product code declares atoms, flows, resources,
tags, and extensions. Composition roots create scopes. Tests create scopes with different presets. UI
components observe the graph instead of owning business logic.

## Install

```bash
npm install @pumped-fn/lite
npm install @pumped-fn/lite-react
```

Use only `@pumped-fn/lite` for backend, workers, command-line tools, and framework-neutral graph logic.
Add `@pumped-fn/lite-react` when React should observe that graph.

## Why This Exists

Most application code has the same hidden problems in different forms:

- Import-time singletons connect early and close late.
- Request state leaks through globals or parameter drilling.
- Frontend components grow validation, async work, derived state, and IO.
- Tests patch modules or browser globals because there is no honest seam.
- Cross-cutting behavior like tracing, auth, logging, and transactions is repeated by hand.

`pumped-fn` makes those concerns explicit without turning the app into a framework. A scope owns the graph.
An execution context owns one request, job, action, or UI boundary. Presets change the radius of a test.
Extensions wrap execution. React is an observer layer.

## Mental Model

```text
composition root
  createScope({ presets, tags, extensions })
        |
        v
scope
  long-lived graph boundary
  atoms: cached capabilities, state, derived data, infrastructure
  controllers/select: opt-in reactivity
        |
        v
execution context
  request, job, action, route, or UI boundary
  flows: input/output work
  resources: transactions, request loggers, form drafts, spans
  tags: tenant, locale, trace id, runtime config
        |
        v
agent workflow
  model and sandbox providers as tags
  tools and subagents as ctx.exec flow steps
  events as a boundary resource
```

The same seam works for backend and frontend:

- Backend handlers create or receive an execution context and run flows.
- Workers create scopes for process lifetime and contexts per job.
- React roots render `ScopeProvider` and `ExecutionContextProvider`.
- Edge renderers such as json-render can bind to Lite-owned scoped values and emit actions into Lite flows.
- Tests use `createScope({ presets, tags, extensions })` and public APIs.

## Core Primitives

| Primitive | Owns | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `createScope` | The composition and test boundary | App roots, server mounts, worker processes, isolated tests |
| `atom` | Scope-owned values | Transports, capabilities, state, derived data, caches |
| `flow` | Short-lived execution | Commands, request handlers, actions with typed input |
| `resource` | Execution-context-owned values | Transactions, request loggers, spans, per-action buffers, form drafts |
| `tag` | Typed ambient values | Tenant, request id, locale, runtime config, equality-aware boundary identity |
| `preset` | Replacement at the seam | Unit radius tests, outside-in adapter tests, tenant-specific implementation swaps |
| `extension` | Cross-cutting wrappers | Logging, tracing, auth, metrics, transactions |
| `controller` / `select` | Opt-in reactivity | UI state, live config, derived subscriptions, invalidation |

## Extension Runtime Options

Extensions are static composition. Runtime backend choices are tags.

Install cross-cutting behavior once at the composition root, then inject sinks and policy through
tags at the scope, request context, or individual flow execution boundary.

```ts
import { createScope } from "@pumped-fn/lite"
import { logging } from "@pumped-fn/lite-extension-logging"
import { observable } from "@pumped-fn/lite-extension-observable"

const events = observable.memory()
const records = logging.memory()

const scope = createScope({
  extensions: [observable.extension(), logging.extension()],
  tags: [
    observable.runtime({ sinks: [events], only: ["flow", "resource"] }),
    logging.runtime({ sinks: [records], level: "info", flow: "errors" }),
  ],
})

const request = scope.createContext({
  tags: [logging.runtime({ sinks: [records], fields: { requestId: "req-1" } })],
})

const logger = await request.resolve(logging.logger)
logger.info("request.accepted")
```

This split keeps the package set small: backend integrations can live outside the core extension
packages and pass a sink through a tag. Tests use the same seam by injecting memory sinks.
OpenTelemetry and OTLP collectors are integration targets for those sinks, not dependencies of the
core extension packages.
Optional backend packages such as `@pumped-fn/lite-extension-observable-otel` and
`@pumped-fn/lite-extension-logging-pino` prove the adapter shape without changing base package size.
The OTEL adapter is standard OTLP-oriented; the same sink can feed Grafana, Victoria, and Jaeger
setups when the application or Collector is configured for their OTLP endpoints.

## Architectural Shape

`pumped-fn` code usually falls into four layers:

| Layer | Responsibility | Rule of thumb |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport atom | Wrap raw ambient IO such as fetch, storage, timers, clock, random, process APIs | Its own unit test may fake the platform below the seam |
| Capability atom | Expose domain/application operations over transports | No raw IO, no token/session plumbing in feature nodes |
| Feature atom or flow | Own application state, decisions, derived data, and use-case execution | Depends on capabilities and resources |
| Composition root | Create scopes, root contexts, providers, route/job mounts, and disposal | Thin, tested adapter; no service-locator helper that accepts `scope` |

That shape lets you test inside-out or outside-in without changing product code. Inside-out tests preset a
unit's direct dependencies. Outside-in tests preset only edge adapters. Needing module mocks, product
branches for test mode, or global patches above a raw transport wrapper is a design smell.

## Backend, BFF, Worker

Use `@pumped-fn/lite` directly when there is no UI.

```ts
import { atom, createScope, flow, resource, tag, tags, typed } from "@pumped-fn/lite"

const tenantId = tag<string>({ label: "tenant.id" })

const http = atom({
  factory: () => ({
    get: async (path: string) => ({ path, ok: true }),
  }),
})

const audit = resource({
  name: "audit",
  ownership: "boundary",
  factory: (ctx) => {
    const events: string[] = []
    ctx.cleanup(() => {
      events.length = 0
    })
    return {
      record(event: string) {
        events.push(event)
      },
      snapshot: () => [...events],
    }
  },
})

const loadDashboard = flow({
  parse: typed<{ userId: string }>(),
  deps: { http, audit, tenantId: tags.required(tenantId) },
  factory: async (ctx, deps) => {
    deps.audit.record(`dashboard:${ctx.input.userId}`)
    return deps.http.get(`/tenants/${deps.tenantId}/users/${ctx.input.userId}/dashboard`)
  },
})

const scope = createScope({ tags: [tenantId("acme")] })
const ctx = scope.createContext()
const dashboard = await ctx.exec({ flow: loadDashboard, input: { userId: "u1" } })
await ctx.close()
await scope.dispose()
```

The same structure works for HTTP handlers, BFF endpoints, scheduled jobs, command handlers, and CLIs.
Adapters translate the outside world into flow input and tags; the graph owns application behavior.

## React

React components should observe and dispatch. They should not create dependencies, mirror graph state, or
own execution lifecycles.

```tsx
import { atom, createScope, flow } from "@pumped-fn/lite"
import { ExecutionContextProvider, ScopeProvider, useAtom, useFlow } from "@pumped-fn/lite-react"

const dashboardState = atom({
  factory: () => ({ title: "Dashboard" }),
})

const refreshDashboard = flow({
  factory: () => undefined,
})

const scope = createScope()

function App() {
  return (
    <ScopeProvider scope={scope}>
      <ExecutionContextProvider>
        <Dashboard />
      </ExecutionContextProvider>
    </ScopeProvider>
  )
}

function Dashboard() {
  const dashboard = useAtom(dashboardState)
  const refresh = useFlow(refreshDashboard)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => refresh.execute()}>
      {dashboard.title}
    </button>
  )
}
```

For forms, modals, editors, and nested UI boundaries, `@pumped-fn/lite-react` provides `scopedValue`.
That state is backed by a current-owned resource, so it is testable without React and resets when the
owning execution context unmounts or is released.

When generated UI needs json-render controlled state, `@pumped-fn/lite-react-json-render` adapts a
`scopedValue` access object to json-render's external `StateStore` shape and adapts json-render action
handlers to Lite flows. The graph still owns state and behavior; json-render observes, writes, and emits
through its normal `JSONUIProvider` contracts. Use it at genuine json-render boundaries such as generated
specs, server-authored forms, or schema-driven editors; hand-authored React should keep using the normal
Lite React hooks directly.

## Tests

The scope is the single seam:

```ts
import { atom, createScope, preset } from "@pumped-fn/lite"

const clock = atom({
  factory: () => ({ now: () => Date.now() }),
})

const timestamp = atom({
  deps: { clock },
  factory: (_ctx, deps) => deps.clock.now(),
})

const scope = createScope({
  presets: [preset(clock, { now: () => 42 })],
})

const value = await scope.resolve(timestamp)
if (value !== 42) throw new Error("expected preset clock")

await scope.dispose()
```

Frontend tests split by responsibility. Graph logic stays in node tests and uses the same scope seam.
Rendered observer tests run in Vitest Browser Mode under `ScopeProvider` and `ExecutionContextProvider`.
Browser mode proves React wiring; it does not replace node logic tests. CI also runs a Lightpanda
smoke against a Vite-served `useFlow` page so browser-runtime drift is caught before release.

`@pumped-fn/lite-lint` codifies the common mistakes: module mocks, stale browser-emulator markers,
definition-handle suffixes, scope-as-argument helpers, shared scope factories, inline ambient IO, React
feature components using scope directly, and local state mirrors.
