## Pumped-design Skill

**pumped-design** - Design, navigate, troubleshoot, and test pumped-fn backend applications using strict organizational patterns.

### Features

- Strict organizational patterns (entrypoints, resources, flows, utilities)
- Sub-skill architecture with 14 specialized reference guides
- Layer-specific testing strategies
- Framework integration guides (Hono, Next.js, TanStack Start)
- AI-assisted catalog system with mermaid diagrams
- Type-safe error handling patterns

### Usage

The skill uses YAML frontmatter tags for AI-driven sub-skill routing. When working with pumped-fn applications, the main SKILL.md determines which references/ sub-skills to load based on task context.

### External Skills

General development workflows use superpowers plugin from marketplace:
- test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion
- requesting-code-review, brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans
- using-git-worktrees, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting

### Marketplace

This skill is published to marketplace as the pumped-design plugin. See `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `claude-skill/plugin.json` for configuration.
