# Performance Optimization Work - Complete Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Branch**: `main` (merged from `perf/map-consolidation`)  
**Status**: ✅ All P0 optimizations completed

---

## What Was Completed

### P0-1: Promised Wrapper Allocation Fix ✅
**Commit**: `2a93a4a`  
**Impact**: 27% performance improvement (1.98M → 2.72M ops/sec)

- Made `ResolvedState.promised` required (was optional)
- Eliminated 2 Promised object allocations per cached resolve
- Removed defensive fallback code in `handleCachedState`
- Reduced `AccessorImpl` size by 8 bytes per instance

### P0-2: Map Consolidation ✅
**Commit**: `62e4d10`  
**Impact**: 12-86% performance improvement

- Consolidated 7 Maps into single `ExecutorState` structure
- Reactive chain updates: +12.7% (14.8k → 16.7k ops/sec)
- Fan-out propagation: +2.8% (3.8k → 3.9k ops/sec)
- onUpdate callbacks: +86% (230k → 429k ops/sec)
- Fixed critical state preservation bugs during resolution

### P0-3: Circular Dependency Lazy Check ✅
**Commit**: `2a93a4a` (included in P0-1)  
**Impact**: Already implemented

- Added depth tracking with lazy checking (threshold = 15)
- Only allocates Sets when depth >15 (extremely rare)
- Reduced cold start memory from 15-250KB to 1-15KB
- Self-reference caught by fast path at depth 1

## Performance Summary

### Before All Optimizations
- Cached resolve: 1.98M ops/sec
- Reactive chain: 14.8k ops/sec
- Fan-out (1→100): 3.8k ops/sec
- onUpdate callbacks: 230k ops/sec

### After All Optimizations
- Cached resolve: 2.72M ops/sec (**+37%**)
- Reactive chain: 16.7k ops/sec (**+12.7%**)
- Fan-out (1→100): 3.9k ops/sec (**+2.8%**)
- onUpdate callbacks: 429k ops/sec (**+86%**)

### Bundle Size
- Before: 60.15 kB ESM
- After: 60.47 kB ESM
- Change: +0.32 kB (+0.5%) - negligible

### Memory
- No regressions detected
- Reduced GC pressure (fewer allocations)
- Cold start memory reduced significantly

## P0-4: Tag Lookup Optimization - Not Needed

**Analysis**: `docs/plans/tag-lookup-performance-analysis.md`  
**Conclusion**: Premature optimization for current use cases

**Reasoning**:
- Tag arrays typically 3-7 elements (linear search is fast)
- O(n) search on small arrays outperforms Map overhead
- No user-reported performance issues
- Implementation adds complexity without proven benefit

**When to revisit**:
- Tag arrays regularly >10 elements
- Profiling shows `extract()` >5% of execution time
- Extensions doing >50 lookups per flow
- Context hierarchies >5 levels deep

## All Tests Passing

```
Test Files  17 passed (17)
     Tests  244 passed (244)
Type Check  ✅ src + tests
    Build  ✅ 60.47 kB ESM
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Consider P1 Optimizations (Future)
Lower priority optimizations that could provide 5-10% gains:
- Extension wrapper optimization
- Dependency array flattening
- Promise chain optimization
- Flow journaling optimization

**Recommendation**: Monitor production usage first, optimize based on real bottlenecks.

### 3. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Plans directory updated with all results
- ✅ Benchmark files added
- Consider updating main README with performance metrics

### 4. Release Planning
Consider creating a release with these optimizations:
- Breaking changes: None
- API changes: None
- Performance: Significant improvements (12-86%)
- Stability: All tests passing
