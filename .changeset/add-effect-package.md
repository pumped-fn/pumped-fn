Add @pumped-fn/effect - lightweight DI package

Minimal effect system for TypeScript with:
- `atom()` - long-lived dependencies with lifecycle
- `flow()` - short-lived execution with input
- `tag()` - metadata attachment/extraction
- `createScope()` - container with resolution caching
- Extension system for cross-cutting concerns

Zero external dependencies, <10KB bundle target.
